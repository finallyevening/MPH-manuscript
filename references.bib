Blood samples were prepared in a fully automated system by protein precipitation followed by solid-phase extraction. The LC-MS-MS method was linear in the range of 0.5 to 500 ng/g for the enantiomers of both analytes. For concentrations above the limit of quantification, coefficients of variation were 15% or less, and the accuracy was 89 to 94%. For 12 postmortem samples in which methylphenidate was not determined to be related to the cause of death, the femoral blood concentration of d-methylphenidate ranged from 5 to 58 ng/g, and from undetected to 48 ng/g for l-methylphenidate (median d/l-ratio 5.9). Ritalinic acid was present at concentrations 10-20 times higher with roughly equal amounts of the d- and l-forms. In blood from 10 living subjects that were not suspected of being intoxicated by methylphenidate, the concentration ranges and patterns were similar to those of the postmortem cases. Thus, methylphenidate does not appear to undergo significant postmortem redistribution.}, journal={Journal of analytical toxicology}, author={Thomsen, Ragnar and Rasmussen, Henrik and Linnet, Kristian and Pagsberg, Anne}, year={2012}, month=jul, pages={560–568} }

In adults, clinical monitoring of MPH therapy is usually performed by measuring plasma MPH concentrations. In children blood sampling is however undesirable. Saliva may be an alternative matrix for monitoring MPH concentrations with the advantage that it can be obtained non-invasively. Therefore, we developed an analytical method for the quantification of MPH in both plasma and saliva. We present the validation of a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometric method using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column (HILIC). In 100μL sample, proteins were precipitated with 750μL acetonitrile/methanol 84/16 (v/v) containing d9-methylphenidate as the internal standard. Standard curves were prepared over the MPH concentration range of 0.5–100.0μg/L. The total analysis time was 45s. Accuracy and within- and between-run imprecision were in the range of 98–108% and less than 7.0%, respectively. Matrix effects were greater for plasma than saliva with 46% and 8% ionization suppression. The matrix effects were adequately compensated by the use of deuterated MPH as internal standard. MPH significantly degraded in plasma and saliva at room temperature and 5°C. Samples were stable at −20°C for at least 4 weeks. The method was successfully applied for the determination of MPH concentrations in plasma and saliva samples from an adult healthy volunteer. Using protein precipitation and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, this method allows fast, accurate and precise quantification of MPH in both plasma and saliva.}, journal={Journal of Chromatography B}, author={Seçilir, A. and Schrier, L. and Bijleveld, Y.
